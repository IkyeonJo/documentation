Decentraland scenes that are built with the 'ECS' module use _systems_ and _componentSystems_ to update the information stored in [components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93component%E2%80%93system) .

_Systems_ execute their methods over the components of every entity in the scene. _componentSystems_ only execute their methods upon entities that contain all the components that are listed as required by the compoentSystem.

## Systems

The methods of a system iterate over all entities that match their requirements.

> Note: Avoid using these unless you truly want to process **all** entities. It's a lot more efficient to run a componentSystem over only the relevant entities.

## componentSystems

componentSystems act upon all entities in the scene that contain the required components.

For example, imagine your scene has several "ball" entities bouncing around. Each of these balls has a `position` component that stores its coordinates and a `physics` component that stores its velocity and acceleration. Your scene also has a series of other entities like a "hoop" and a "scoreBoard", these only have a `position` component in them.

In your scene there's also a _componentSystem_ called `physicsSystem` that includes an `update()` function, which runs on every frame of the game loop. This componentSystem requires entities to have a `position` and `physics` component. Because of this requirement, it only deals with "ball" entities and ignores any other entities in the scene that don't have both a `position` a `physics` component.

Each time the `update()` function runs, it iterates over all the applicable entities and changes the values on their `position` component based on calculations using the information on that entity's `physics` component.

> Tip: If you only want a componentSystem to act on some of the entities that hold the required components, you can create a custom component to act as as a flag and require that component in the componentSystem.

#### The entity list

The componentSystem keeps track of a list of entities that have the required components to be processed by it. Each time a new entity is created or deleted, or that an entity adds or removes a new component, this list is verified again.

When the componentSystem runs one of its methods, `this.targets` will refer to an array containing all the entities on that list.

## The update method

If a system or componentSystem has a method named `update()`, the engine will run it periodically, once per every frame of the game loop.

Most often, the `update()` method is where you add most of the logic implemented by the system or componentSystem.

The `update()` method always receives an argument called `dt` (representing _delta time_) of type `number`, even when this argument isn't explicitly declared.

#### Delta time

This _delta time_ represents time that it took for the last frame to be processed, in milliseconds.

Decentraland scenes are updated by default at 30 frames per second. This means that the `dt` argument passed to all `update()` methods is generally equal to 30/1000.

If the processing of a frame takes less time than this interval, then the engine will wait the remaining time to keep updates regularly paced and `dt` will remain equal to 30/1000.

[DIAGRAM TIMELINE WITH SHORT PROCESS]

If the processing of a frame takes longer than 30/1000 milliseconds, the drawing of that frame is delayed. The engine tries to finish that frame as soon as possible. It then stats the next frame at the point where the last left off and tries to make it last 30/1000 milliseconds as of that point.

[DIAGRAM TIMELINE WITH LONG PROCESS]

Ideally, you should try to avoid having your scene reach this situation, as it causes a drop in framerate.

The `dt` variable becomes useful when frame processing exceeds the default time. Assuming that the current frame will take as much time as the previous, this information may be used to calculate how much to adjust change so that it remains steady and in proportion to the lag between frames.

## Use a componentSystem as a list

You could define a componentSystem with no `update()` method. This componentSystem wouldn't run any code in between frames, but it would keep track of a list of entities that include the required components. This list could be referenced by another componentSystem, as a handy way to have a list of entities that's filtered according to a specific criteria.
